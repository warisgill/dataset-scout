```

Plain Python iterator pipeline. No DAG framework, no Celery, no Ray.
Library is the source of truth — every verb is a `run_<verb>(ctx, ...)`
function; CLI is a thin wrapper.

## 3. Library API surface

The library is the source of truth; the CLI is a thin wrapper.

```python
from dataset_scout import (
    ScoutContext,
    recon,
    inspect,
    curate,
)

ctx = ScoutContext.from_env()
result = recon("your brief here", ctx=ctx)

# result is a ReconResult with: intent, candidates (Scorecards),
# sources_searched, coverage (when LLM ran), elapsed_seconds, notices.
```

Everything in the public surface is **Pydantic v2**, so JSON
serialization, JSON Schema export, and round-trip validation are free.

---

## 4. Source plugin contract

```python
class Source(Protocol):
    name: str

    def search(
        self,
        intent: Intent,
        directions: list[DecompositionDirection],
        *,
        budget: Budget,
    ) -> Iterator[Candidate]: ...

    def fetch_metadata(self, candidate: Candidate) -> dict[str, Any]: ...

    def stream_sample(
        self, candidate: Candidate, n: int, seed: int,
    ) -> Iterator[dict[str, Any]]: ...

    def card_url(self, candidate: Candidate) -> str: ...

    def terms_check(self, intent: Intent) -> list[Obligation]: ...
```

Sources are registered via `pyproject.toml` `entry_points` in the
`dataset_scout.sources` group. HuggingFace and Kaggle sources are
wired today. A PWC entry-point hook is reserved but not yet wired.

Crucially, every source plugin populates the **same**
`CandidateMetadata` envelope. Probes never read source-specific keys.

---

## 5. Probe protocol

```python
class Probe(Protocol):
    name: str
    version: str
    def applies(self, candidate: Candidate, intent: Intent) -> bool: ...
    def run(self, candidate: Candidate, intent: Intent) -> SubScore: ...
```

Probes are stateless and parallelizable. The version field anchors
future cache keys: `(candidate.revision, probe.version, intent.stable_hash())`.

The six **cheap** probes consume only `CandidateMetadata` (no row
sampling). The **embedding label-intent fit** stage runs as a
dedicated step between cheap probes and the shortlist — it embeds
intent + candidate text via `AZURE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING_DEPLOYMENT` and
writes `Scorecard.label_intent_fit`. `label_structure` and
`schema_fingerprint` are not yet wired.

---

## 6. Mode detection

```python
def llm_available(ctx: ScoutContext) -> bool:
    return ctx.aoai_configured
```

Cheap one-liner. Importantly, it does **not** import `litellm` or
`azure-identity` (~10 s import cost on first use). Users with no AOAI
configured pay nothing.

When `llm_available` returns False, the pipeline:

- Skips decomposition entirely.
- Emits the `METADATA_ONLY_NOTICE` on stderr and as a prominent header
  in `report.md`, naming the env vars to set.
- Still runs HF search + cheap probes — discovery still works.

When `llm_available` returns True but the call fails at runtime
(expired token, network, rate limit), the same fallback kicks in
with a more specific notice.

---

## 7. Events

The pipeline emits `ProgressEvent`s as it works:

```python
class ProgressEventKind(StrEnum):
    STAGE_STARTED, STAGE_FINISHED,
    CANDIDATE_FOUND, CANDIDATE_SCORED,
    DIRECTION_PROPOSED, STRATEGY_ASSESSED,
    NOTICE, WARNING
```

Tests collect events into a list to assert on. The CLI passes a sink
that renders to rich progress bars (lands properly in M2b). A future
HTTP API forwards them as SSE / WebSocket frames. Same code path.

---

## 8. Cache

SQLite WAL at `~/.cache/dataset-scout/cache.db`, single-writer file
lock, LRU eviction at 2 GB default cap. Key namespaces:

```
hf_meta:{id}:{revision}                          (TTL 7d)
hf_sample:{id}:{revision}:{seed}                 (infinite)
probe:{source}:{id}:{revision}:{name}:{version}
embed_fit:{source}:{id}:{revision}:{intent_hash}
strategy:{source}:{id}:{revision}:{intent_hash}:{assessor_v}
decompose:{intent_hash}:{decomposer_v}
coverage:{intent_hash}:{candidate_set_hash}:{coverage_v}
```

`Intent.stable_hash()` already exists today; the key scheme is
straightforward to extend when new call sites are added.

---

## 9. Tests

Three tiers:

| Marker | Network? | Gates? |
|---|---|---|
| `pytest -m unit` | No | every PR (currently 154 tests) |
| `pytest -m recorded` | respx-replayed | every PR |
| `pytest -m live` | Real HF + AOAI | nightly only |

LLM calls in tests are mocked at the `litellm.completion` boundary
with canned JSON responses. Decomposition + (future) strategy
prompts are **snapshot-tested** — drift surfaces as a PR diff.

---

## 10. Status

### Shipped

| Capability | What's in |
|---|---|
| **Discovery (dataset platforms)** | HuggingFace + Kaggle source plugins, 6 metadata-driven probes, deduplicated multi-source candidate pool, `surfaced_by` provenance. Kaggle is discovery-only — `stream_sample`/`stream_rows` raise `SourceUnsupportedError` and curate classifies the candidate under `unsupported_source` with a hint. |
| **Discovery (academic papers)** | Pipeline stage querying Semantic Scholar across NeurIPS / ICML / ICLR / SaTML, with arXiv as a targeted fallback for named-benchmark queries when S2 is unavailable or throttled. Round-robin per-direction queries, regex extraction of HF/Kaggle/GitHub dataset URLs from abstracts, deduplicated by arXiv ID, capped at 20 papers per recon. Cited HF / Kaggle datasets are promoted into the candidate pool with `surfaced_by` carrying the paper id. CLI: `--no-papers` opts out. Cached per `(venue-set, year-range, query)`. |
| **Cache** | SQLite WAL at `<ctx.cache_dir>/cache.db`. Namespace-scoped TTL defaults with per-call override; age-based eviction at a 2 GB cap (`DATASET_SCOUT_CACHE_MAX_BYTES`); read paths never write. Wraps decompose, strategy, embedding, and paper-search calls. CLI: `datascout cache info\|prune\|clear`. |
| **LLM decomposition** | Azure OpenAI / Entra. Brief → 3–7 adjacent search directions. Reusable via `--decomposition-from` for cheap iteration. Cached. Mode-detection falls back to metadata-only with an explicit notice when AOAI is absent. |
| **Row-aware strategy assessor** | Shortlists the top ~35 candidates per axis (LLM-cost budget; recalled-name rescues force-included); remaining candidates stay in the pool but are unassessed. For each shortlisted candidate: stream 8 real rows → LLM call → 1–4 ranked strategies from the 7-kind taxonomy with rationale, caveats, and a transform spec referencing **actual** columns and label values. Cached. |
| **Embedding label-intent fit** | Dedicated pipeline stage between probes and the assessor. Embeds intent text + a deterministic candidate text (description + canonical row sample) via Azure OpenAI embeddings (`AZURE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING_DEPLOYMENT`). Writes `Scorecard.label_intent_fit`. Cached per text hash; the intent embedding is reused across candidates. |
| **Coverage-gap report** | What no candidate covers and where to source it. Leads `report.md`/`report.html` when notable. |
| **Reports** | `report.md` (audit-friendly Markdown) and `report.html` (self-contained HTML, embedded CSS, color-coded strategy badges, no JS) rendered from a shared `ReconReportContext` view-model so the two can't drift. |
| **`tour`** | Canned no-setup demo. Writes both Markdown and HTML when `--out` is given. |
| **`inspect`** | Single-candidate deep-dive: schema, Wilson 95% CI label distribution, length stats, license, strategy assessment. |
| **`curate`** | Audit-ready: parallel materialisation with deterministic reassembly, MinHash + LSH dedup, leakage-aware splits, sandboxed filter DSL, per-component soft-failure classification (now including `unsupported_source` for Kaggle), full `recipe.lock.yaml` audit trail. |
| **`judge` + `eval`** | Opt-in LLM-as-judge label rescue with sha256-cached verdicts, per-batch resumable checkpoint, multi-judge agreement, explicit-gap promotion, calibration mode with precision floor. Standalone `eval` against any gold corpus. |
| **`compose`** | Merge multiple recipes for shared multi-detection corpora. |

**Paper discovery limits.** Only datasets with a HuggingFace or
Kaggle URL in the abstract are promoted to candidates. Datasets on
author sites or generic GitHub repos surface as paper citations but
stop there — verify those manually. Semantic Scholar rate-limits
under parallel runs; arXiv falls back as a second source for
named-benchmark queries; if both fail, recon proceeds without the
paper channel rather than blocking.

**Assessor scope.** The shortlist caps at ~35 candidates per axis
(recalled-name rescues — datasets the decomposer named explicitly —
are force-included on top of that). The remaining candidates stay
in the pool but are unassessed. When an axis comes back empty,
sweep the full candidate list before declaring a coverage gap.

## 11. Voice for output

The audience is detection engineers under audit pressure. **No
aggregate "quality" headlines.** Receipts everywhere. Proxies are
honest by default (see `label_kind` in [concepts.md](concepts.md)).
"This is not legal advice" footer on any report touching licensing.
