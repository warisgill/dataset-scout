"""Academic-paper discovery channel.

Adds a discovery surface beyond the dataset-platform Source plugins:
papers from leading ML / security venues that may *cite* relevant
datasets. The pipeline runs this stage between probes and the strategy
assessor and:

  1. Records the relevant papers (title, abstract, link) in
     `ReconResult.papers` so the report can render a "Related papers
     and dataset citations" section.
  2. Promotes any HuggingFace / Kaggle dataset URL extracted from a
     paper's abstract into the existing candidate pool, with
     `surfaced_by` carrying the paper id. Existing strategy /
     coverage flow then runs over those candidates normally.

Why a stage and not a Source plugin? Papers ≠ datasets. A Source's
contract is to yield Candidates that are datasets; mixing papers in
breaks the strategy assessor (no rows to stream, no transform). Papers
are referrers — different shape, separate render section.

Backed by the **Semantic Scholar Graph API** (free, no auth required
for moderate use). Single endpoint covers all four target venues with
abstracts and citation counts.
