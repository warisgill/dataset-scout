"""The recon pipeline.

M2a: parse → (decompose if LLM available) → multi-direction search →
cheap probes → ReconResult.

Mode is decided once at the top by `decompose.llm_available(ctx)` and
the `explore` flag. When the LLM is available and `explore=True`, the
pipeline runs the full decomposition + multi-direction search. When
not, it runs in metadata-only mode and emits an explicit notice in the
result so the report is honest about the difference.

Strategy assessor + coverage report land in M2b.

        Explicit ScoutContext (no global state).
    parser_overrides
        CLI-flag-derived overrides applied to the parsed Intent.
    max_candidates
        Upper bound on candidates surfaced in the report.
    events
        If provided, ProgressEvent entries are appended for each stage.
    probes / sources
        Dependency-injection hooks. Defaults wire the cheap probe set
        and HuggingFaceSource.
    explore
        If False, skip decomposition unconditionally (debug). The CLI
        wires this to a hidden `--no-explore` flag.
    directions_override

        the LLM. Lets `--decomposition-from <path>` reuse a hand-edited
        decomposition.yaml without paying for a fresh LLM call.
    paper_search_fn
        Injection hook for the academic-paper discovery stage. Default
        (None) wires `dataset_scout.paper_search.find_papers_and_promote`.
        Tests pass a no-op or a respx-backed stub. Set to a callable
